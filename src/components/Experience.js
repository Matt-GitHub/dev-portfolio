        I am a software engineer, currently based in the Greater Philadelphia
        Area. Formally trained in Finance but fell in love with the creativity
        and problem solving that comes with being an engineer. Most of the time
        you can find me working on a project that includes JavaScript, React,
        and Node js. When I have free time I find myself working out, cooking a
        meal with semi-adherence to the online recipe (so many spices) or
        navigating my way through the world of computer science. That's enough
        about me, for now, if you would like to extend the conversation, reach
        out!
